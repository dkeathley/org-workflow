* Notes
** Usage .gif files

Thinking through what steps would be useful to demo:

 1. Move project up to stage one level up/down
 2. Move project to top/bottom of the current list of projects
 3. Create a new project
 4. Attaching files
    1. Demonstrate naming conventions
    2. Demonstrate usage of =PROJ-TYPE= property


* Tasks

** TODO Create .gif files providing usage instructions for org-workflow.

** TODO Provide a way to rename the attachment folder

Currently it assumes the attachment folder is permanently named after initial generation.  This might not always be preferred.  For instance, if you want to move it around to another workflow.

Could add a convenience function that rejects the current =PROJ-TYPE= property and uses that to rename any existing project folder if it already exists as well as the =DIR= property of the current project at point.
